# Contributing to ETMS
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Branch name conventions
We have a few grouping that must be added before your banch name.

* feature/<branch-name>: A new feature is being added
* refactor/<branch-name>: You are refactoring a code to improve it in any aspect you thing it is necessary.
* bugfix/<branch-name>: You are fixing a existing bug


## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Enactus-UFRGS/enactus-team-management-frontend/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Here are some general guidelines:
 
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs

And below are the language specific ones

### Javascript style guides

For javascript we use the [Google Guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
excepct for the semicolon requirement. In this project semicolons we do not use semicolons in the end of statements. 

### CSS style guides

We follow the [Airbnb CSS style guides](https://github.com/airbnb/css).

Please take a good look at it but, for TL;DR, here are the main main you should know:

* We use a combination of [BEM](http://getbem.com/) and [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki)
* We use SASS as a CSS preprocessor. Please always use the .scss syntax and not the .sass one.
